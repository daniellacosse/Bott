# **Security Policy**

**If you encounter a security vulnerability, do _not_ open a GitHub Issue.**
Instead, send an email to [D@nielLaCos.se](mailto:d@niellacos.se), making sure
to include as much information as possible to help me reproduce the issue:

- **Description of the vulnerability:** What is the nature of the security flaw?
- **Steps to reproduce:** Be clear and concise here.
- **Impact:** What is the potential impact of this vulnerability? (e.g., data
  breach, remote code execution, denial of service).
- **Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots:** These are extremely helpful.

Once I receive your email, I'll acknowledge receipt of your report within a week
or so, then again when I've managed to reproduce it. Once the vulnerability is
patched, I'll publicly disclose the vulnerability (e.g., via GitHub and Discord)
and credit you, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
